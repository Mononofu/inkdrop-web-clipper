# Inkdrop Web Clipper

A plugin for [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.info/) which allows you to clip web pages into new notes, similar to Evernote or OneNote.


It uses [Readability.js](https://github.com/mozilla/readability/) to extract the article content, and converts it into Markdown automatically.

## Usage

Select `Plugins` > `Clip Web Page...` from the menu bar, or press (default) `Ctrl+Alt+C`.

## Acknowledgement
